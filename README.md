1. In the **InPrivate** browser window, in the Azure portal, search and select **Help + support** and then click **+ Create a support request**. 

1. In the **InPrivate** browser window, on the **Problem Description/Summary** tab of the **Help + support - New support request** blade, type **Service and subscription limits** in the Summary field and select the **Service and subscription limits (quotas)** issue type. Note that the subscription you are using in this lab is listed in the **Subscription** drop-down list.

    >**Note**: The presence of the subscription you are using in this lab in the **Subscription** drop-down list indicates that the account you are using has the permissions required to create the subscription-specific support request.

    >**Note**: If you do not see the **Service and subscription limits (quotas)** option, sign out from the Azure portal and sign in back.
